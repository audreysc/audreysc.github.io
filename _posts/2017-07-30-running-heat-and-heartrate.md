title: "Heartrate and Temperature (three 6 mile runs)"

I got a fitbit in January and I love it, I have been fascinated by the heart rate feature. One observation has been that my heartrate is much higher when running in hot weather, and that at a certain point, this elevated heartrate limits my pace. I feel as though I am running all out, however I am actually running significantly slower than on a less hot day. After looking around online and not finding much on the topic, I decided to compile three 6 mile runs and compare the relative temperatures, paces, and heartrates. 

This isn't a scientific analysis by any means, but its fun and writing about it gives me an outlet because I think people are tired of hearing me talk about it! I debated whether to include shorter runs and runs that I wasn't sure of the distances for, but settled on including three 6 mile runs.

### March 7

- Temperature: high 40s (42-56 degrees for the day)
- Time: 6 pm
- Pace: 8:30

### July 19

- Temperature: 95 degrees
- Date: 6 pm
- Pace: ~9:40

### July 26

- Temperature: low 80s (70-87 degrees for the day)
- Date: 6 pm
- Pace: ~8:20

One possible explanation for this heart rate behavior, is unfortunately, that I am in significantly worse shape now than I was in March. However, based on my pace in the March run and the second July run, this explanation seems (thankfully) unlikely.
